# zkAccess

An app used to create secret circles and add people anonymously by scanning their `zKeys` (`Passkeys`â€™ public kyes). People generate zero-knowledge proofs to prove a circle's membership. Build on top of the [Ceramic Network](https://ceramic.network) using [zkp-ECDSA](https://github.com/cloudflare/zkp-ecdsa) and `webauthn` standards.
